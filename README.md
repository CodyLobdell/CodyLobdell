**`Software Developer & Tech-Entrepreneur`** 

Hello there and welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full-stack developer and technological enthusiast with a knack for creating functional projects. 
All the projects currently with my GitHub are constructed from the ground up, focusing on expading my knowledge and practice with code.

As a military verteran, I have a background in Geospatial Imagery Analysis and WAAAAY before that, culinary arts!

In my downtime I love to get outdoors and check out local trail routes. I also enjoy dancing, video games, horror movies, and house music!

I hope to one day create or assist in the creation of of a positive, world-changing product!
